    "text": "The Ghana Statistical Service has been consistent in performing its legal functions to serve the needs of individuals, organisations, development partners and the government without hindrance. However, the need to improve the legal framework to reflect changes in the statistics landscape worldwide has resulted in the promulgation of a new law- Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003) to replace the Statistical Service Law, 1985. The New Law establishes the Ghana Statistical Service as the central statistics producing and co-ordinating institution for the National Statistical System and to strengthen the production of quality, relevant, accurate and timely statistical information for the purpose of national development.\nThe New Law specifically mandates the Service to: (a) Provide leadership and direction for the efficient, consistent and comprehensive collection, processing, analysis, documentation and storage of statistical information within the National Statistical System; (b) Collect, compile, analyse, abstract, publish and disseminate statistical information related to the commercial, industrial, financial, social, demographic, economic and other activities and conditions of the people or this country through the conduct of surveys and national censuses, including population, housing, economic and agricultural censuses; (c) Determine the manner in which the Ministries, Departments, Agencies, District Assemblies and statutory bodies collaborate with the Service in the collection, compilation and publication of statistical information, including statistics derived from the activities of those entities; (d) Develop, create awareness and operationalize the code of ethics and practice for the production and use of data to ensure quality of statistics with respect to relevance, accuracy and reliability, coherence and comparability, sustainability, continuity, timeliness, topicality and integrity; (e) Manage a centrally organized database of (i) Commercial, industrial, financial, social, demographic and economic survey and censuses data sets at the micro and macro levels, (ii) Statistical indicators, and (iii) Metadata on the statistical processes within the National Statistical System; (f) Review, assess, classify and designate as official statistics, data produced by the Service, Ministries, Departments and Agencies, District Assemblies and other institutions within the country and report regularly on the state of official statistics to the Government and the people; (g) Promote and build statistical capacity and professional competencies using diverse interventions including the establishment and operation of a National Statistical Training Centre; (h) Prescribe and direct the pursuance of scientific independence, impartiality, responsibility and transparency in statistical production; and (i) Promote bilateral and multilateral statistics co-operation and partnership to upgrade statistics production systems in the country."

    "section": "2.1 Grammar and Style",
    "text": "2.1 Grammar and Style\n\nAll reports should be written in a formal professional style and free of grammatical and typographical errors. Writers are encouraged to utilise the word processing software or online editing tools to review their drafts before submission.\n\n\n2.1.1 Language\nGSS produces publications for diverse users including policy makers, civil society organisations, development partners and the private sector. As such reports should be written in clear non-technical language. Writers should use more common words and restrict usage of jargon to increase the readability of reports. When technical terms are used, they should be properly explained.\nReports should exclude:\n\n  contractions (e.g., can’t, don’t)\n  shorthand (e.g., &, cont’d,)\n  shortened word forms (e.g., org., dept.)\n  colloquial expressions (e.g., kids, folks, a bunch of, lots of)\n  idioms (e.g., deal with, on the flip side, boils down to)\n\nWriters should also avoid the use of local slang such as dumsor (persistent power outages). Local slang can be used when there is no formal alternative, but should be italicised example, trotro, or chop bar. Where there is a formal but less recognised alternative, the slang can be inserted in parentheses e.g., female porters (kayayei).\nReports should be written in the third person and avoid the use of personal pronouns such as, I and we.\n\n\n1.1.2 Clarity\nAs much as possible, reports should use the active voice (e.g., the Statistical Service conducted a three-day training for five enumerators) and avoid the passive voice (e.g., five enumerators were trained for three days).\nWriters should use specific figures and avoid subjective quantifiers such as many, a few, and most.\nWriters should similarly avoid using adverbs such as very, really, and quite as descriptive words and rather use one fitting word e.g., rapidly (very quickly), sizeable (really large), moderately (quite slowly).\n\n\n2.1.3 Verbosity\nWhile there are no strict limits to sentence lengths, writers are advised to have an average of 12 to 15 words per sentence in their reports.\nSimilarly, writers are advised to average three to five sentences per paragraph.\nWriters should aim for short succinct sentences. For instance, “The purpose of the pre-test was to assess the questionnaire” (10 words) can be “The pre-test assessed the questionnaire” (five words).\nPhrases should be replaced with single words whenever possible. Some suggestions are provided below: .\n\n\n\n\nOne word\nPhrase\n\n\n\n\nBecause\nAs a consequence of, due to the fact that\n\n\nFor\nFor the purpose of\n\n\nDespite, although\nIn spite of the fact that\n\n\nWithout\nIn the absence of\n\n\nWhile, during\nIn the course of\n\n\nExamine, explore, assess\nLook closely at, to find out whether\n\n\nDaily\nOn a daily basis\n\n\nComprises\nConsists of\n\n\nConsidering\nIn view of\n\n\nExcludes\nDoes not include\n\n\nEquivalent, similar\nThe same as\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Tenses\nVerb tenses should be consistent throughout. The recommended tenses are presented below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection\nTense\nExample\n\n\n\n\nOverview including field operations, and other activities completed prior to report writing\nPast\nGSS developed two categories of instruments for the 2021 PHC: the listing form and the enumeration instruments.\n\n\nLiterature review\nPresent perfect\nBeing behind grade for age has been shown to negatively influence students’ academic and socio-emotional outcomes.\n\n\n\nPast\nAnarfi, Awusabo-Asare, and Nsowah-Nuamah (2000) estimated that there were 500,000 to 800,000 Ghanaians in Côte d’Ivoire in 1986.\n\n\nData and methodology\nPresent\nThe statistics presented in this thematic brief are generated from the 2021 PHC and on trends are complemented with data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses.\n\n\nFindings and highlights\nPresent\nThree in ten (30.2%) persons 6 years and older are not literate in any language.\n\n\n\nPast tense can be used for historical comparisons\nUrban and rural populations increased in all regions between 2010 and 2021 except Eastern and Ahafo regions where rural population decreased.\n\n\nConclusions\nPresent\nThe findings indicate that a substantial share of children is being deprived of their rights as outlined in the 1992 Constitution and the 1998 Children’s Act.\n\n\nRecommendations\nPresent\nGiven the observed protective influence of schooling on girls, it is particularly important for a coordinated effort to ensure that girls start and stay in school.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Punctuation\nWhen a list within a sentence contains three or more items, a comma must be used after all items except the last one as shown below :\nThis report presents data on literacy, current school attendance, and educational attainment.\nWhen items in the list contain commas, semicolons should be used to separate items as shown below:\nThis publication targets Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs); Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs); development partners; civil society organisations (CSOs); private sector; research and academia; and the public.\nOne space should separate sentences within a paragraph.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Subject verb agreement\nInstitutions are singular e.g., GSS produces quality data.\nData should be considered a collective noun e.g., the data shows fertility has declined overtime.\nStatistics should be referred to in the plural e.g., statistics indicate that fertility has declined overtime.\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Capitalisation of Words\nCapital letters should be used for the first words in sentences and for proper nouns. Proper nouns refer to specific persons, or places. Common nouns, which are general, should not be capitalised. An example is shown below:\n“We are also indebted to the universities for their technical support, particularly the University of Ghana and the University of Cape Coast.”\nThe names of regions should be capitalised as such Greater Accra Region. When referring to two or more regions however, regions must not be capitalised. An example is shown below:\n“The Northern Region (14,031) has the highest number of girls aged 12 to 17 years who have ever been in union, followed distantly by the Ashanti (9,767) and Greater Accra regions (6,063).”\nCOVID-19 should be capitalised while coronavirus is written in small letters."

Exceptions include age e.g., persons aged 5 years and currency e.g., GH₵8.\nOrdinal numbers from first to ninth must also be spelled out. 10th and above can be written in figures.\nNumbers above 999 must be written with commas e.g., 511,622.\nWhen a percentage figure is mentioned in a text, the words ‘per cent’ should follow the figure. However, if the figure is quoted in brackets, the percentage symbol (%) should be used. An example is:\n“Among children engaged in economic activity, almost 80 per cent are involved in agriculture-related activities with the highest proportion in Savannah (89.8%) and the least in Greater Accra (26.2%).”\nSentences beginning with numbers should have the figures written out in words regardless of whether the number is below or above ten. An example is:\n“Thirteen per cent of those who have attended school in the past have tertiary education as the highest level attained.”\nFractions (e.g., one-fifth) should be written in words.\nUse “to” in text and not hyphens when referring to ranges e.g., 15 to 19 years.\nNumbers above 1,000 should be fully written out and abbreviations (such as 1k) should not be used.\nNumbers above 1,000,000 can be written in figures and words e.g., 2 million."

    "text": "Bar charts\nA bar chart is an effective way to visually represent data that is categorical or discrete in nature for example different regions in Ghana). It is particularly useful when comparing values across different categories or groups. Bar charts are ideal for showing the distribution or frequency of data, as well as identifying trends or patterns over time. They can be used to display numerical data such as quantities, percentages, and proportions. Overall, a bar chart is appropriate when you want to easily compare different categories or groups and understand the relative differences between them.\n\nn_chopbars_df  <- tribble(~region_number, ~region, ~number_of_chop_bars,\n                            1,\"Western\", 567,\n                            2, \"Central\", 907,\n                            3, \"Greater Accra\", 6990,\n                            4, \"Volta\", 278,\n                            5, \"Eastern\", 787,\n                            6, \"Ashanti\",5621,\n                            7, \"Western North\", 345,\n                            8,  \"Ahafo\", 678,\n                            9, \"Bono\",1268,\n                            10,\"Bono East\", 1268,\n                            11,\"Oti\",773,\n                            12,\"Northern\", 112,\n                            13,\"Savannah\", 1289,\n                            14,\"North East\",378,\n                            15,\"Upper East\",1279,\n                            16, \"Upper West\", 3782) \n\nn_chopbars_df %>%\n    kable()\n\n\n\n\nregion_number\nregion\nnumber_of_chop_bars\n\n\n\n\n1\nWestern\n567\n\n\n2\nCentral\n907\n\n\n3\nGreater Accra\n6990\n\n\n4\nVolta\n278\n\n\n5\nEastern\n787\n\n\n6\nAshanti\n5621\n\n\n7\nWestern North\n345\n\n\n8\nAhafo\n678\n\n\n9\nBono\n1268\n\n\n10\nBono East\n1268\n\n\n11\nOti\n773\n\n\n12\nNorthern\n112\n\n\n13\nSavannah\n1289\n\n\n14\nNorth East\n378\n\n\n15\nUpper East\n1279\n\n\n16\nUpper West\n3782\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Color\n\n# Pipe operator to pass data frame to the next line\nn_chopbars_df %>% \n  # Create a ggplot object and set the aesthetic mappings\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = region, y = number_of_chop_bars)) +\n  # Add a column chart with bars of equal width\n  geom_col(width = 0.8) +\n  # Apply a custom theme to the plot\n  gssthemes() +\n# The expand argument controls whether the range of the y-axis is expanded to include a small margin around the data.

This example uses geom_bar() which sums the values and generates a value for bar heights. In this example, position = \"fill\" in geom_bar() changes the y-axis from count to the proportion of each bar.\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(am = factor(am, labels = c(\"Automatic\", \"Manual\")),\n         cyl = factor(cyl)) %>%  \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cyl, fill = am), position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.1)), labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(x = \"Cylinders\",\n       y = NULL) +  \n  remove_ticks() +\n  guides(color = FALSE)\n\n\nLollipop plot\n\nmtcars %>%\n    rownames_to_column(\"model\") %>%\n    arrange(mpg) %>%\n    mutate(model = factor(model, levels = .$model)) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(mpg, model)) +\n        geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = mpg, y = model, yend = model)) + \n        geom_point() +\n        scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0)), limits = c(0, 40)) +\n        labs(x = NULL, \n                 y = \"Miles Per Gallon\")\n\n\n\n\nDumbell plot"

Use scatter_grid() from library(urbnthemes) to easily add vertical grid lines for scatter plots.\n\nmtcars %>%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)), \n                     limits = c(0, 6),\n                     breaks = 0:6) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.002)), \n                     limits = c(0, 40),\n                     breaks = 0:8 * 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (thousands of pounds)\",\n       y = \"City MPG\") +\n  scatter_grid()\n\n\n\nMulti Color Scatter Plot\nSometimes transparency isn’t enough to bring clarity to a scatter plot with many observations. As n increases into the hundreds of thousands and even millions, geom_hex can be one of the best ways to display relationships between two variables.\n\n\nScatter Plots with Varying Point Size\nWeights and populations can be mapped in scatter plots to the size of the points. Here, the number of households in each state is mapped to the size of each point using aes(size = hhpop). Note: ggplot2::geom_point() is used instead of geom_point().\n\n\nScatter Plots with Fill\nA third aesthetic can be added to scatter plots. Here, color signifies the number of cylinders in each car. Before ggplot() is called, Cylinders is created using library(dplyr) and the piping operator %>%.\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(cyl = paste(cyl, \"cylinders\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)), \n                     limits = c(0, 6),\n                     breaks = 0:6) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.002)), \n                     limits = c(0, 40),\n                     breaks = 0:8 * 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (thousands of pounds)\",\n       y = \"City MPG\") +\n  scatter_grid()"

Essentially, variable titles go into “key” and variable values go into “value”. Then ggplot2, turns the different levels of the key variable (population, unemployment) into colors.\n\nas_tibble(EuStockMarkets) %>%\n    mutate(date = time(EuStockMarkets)) %>%\n    gather(key = \"key\", value = \"value\", -date) %>%\n    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = value, color = key)) +\n    geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)), \n                     limits = c(1991, 1999), \n                     breaks = c(1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.002)), \n                     breaks = 0:4 * 2500,\n                     labels = scales::dollar, \n                     limits = c(0, 10000)) +  \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n             y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\nHistograms\nHistograms divide the distribution of a variable into n equal-sized bins and then count and display the number of observations in each bin. Histograms are sensitive to bin width. As ?geom_histogram notes, “You should always override [the default binwidth] value, exploring multiple widths to find the best to illustrate the stories in your data.”\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = depth)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)), \n                     limits = c(0, 100)) +  \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.2)), labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(x = \"Depth\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\nBoxplots\nBoxplots were invented in the 1970s by John Tukey1. Instead of showing the underlying data or binned counts of the underlying data, they focus on important values like the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile.\n\nInsectSprays %>%\n  ggplot(mapping =  aes(x = spray, y = count)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.2))) +\n  labs(x = \"Type of insect spray\",\n       y = \"Number of dead insects\") +\n  remove_ticks()"
