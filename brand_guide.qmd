# 1. REPORT DESIGN

## [1.1 Cover Design]{.underline}

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
The front cover design of the report must have the logos, the name of the census/survey/routine or administrative data report, the volume number of the report if applicable, the name of the report, images which reflect the content of the report, and the month and year of publication.

All text on the cover page should be in **UPPER CASE**.

The back cover of the report should have the logo of the Statistical Service and the link to the GSS website.

### 1.1.1 Use of Images

The use of images on the cover page must reflect the content and themes of the report.

The images should be semi-transparent and placed behind the title of the report underneath the logos and the name of the census/survey/routine or administrative data report.

### 1.1.2 Use of logos

The cover design of the report should have Ghana's Coat of Arms and the Statistical Service logo at the top of the page, with the Coat of Arms on the left, and the GSS logo on the right.

When available, census/survey/routine or administrative data report logos must be placed between the Coat of Arms and the GSS logo as illustrated below.

![](images/logouse.png){width="80%"}

The logos of the organisations involved, or programmes associated with the project should be placed at the bottom part of the cover page.

Writers should ensure that the correct GSS logo (shown below) is used. Logos should not be resized or reshaped.

## [1.5 Font]{.underline}

### 1.5.1 Size, Style, Colour and Capitalisation of Text

The font type Century Gothic (Body) should be used for text. Below are the font sizes, styles, colours, and indentation for the different levels of text:

Heading one should be used for chapter or section headings numbered 1, 2, 3 etc. The subsequent heading styles should be used for the different sub-section levels.

```{=html}
<h3>HEADING ONE (FONT SIZE 16; BOLD; UPPER CASE; BLACK)</h3>
<h4>Heading Two (font size 14; bold; black; capitalise each word)</h4>
<br>
<h5>&emsp;&emsp;Heading Three (font size 13; bold; black; capitalise each word)</h5>
<br>
<h6>&emsp;&emsp;Heading Four (font size 12; bold; italics; black; capitalise each word)</h6><br>
```
Text within paragraph

-   

          (Font size 11; black; capitalise first word of sentence and proper nouns) 

Figure title

-   

          (font size 11; bold; small caps case; black, lighter 35%)

Table title

-   

          (font size 11; bold; small caps case; black, lighter 35%)

-   

          (FONT SIZE 9; UPPER CASE; WHITE, DARKER 50%) 

<br>

### 1.5.2 Tables

The font type Arial Narrow, font size 11 should be used for tables in the reports. In cases where tables have too many columns to fit the font size 11, a smaller size can be used.

<br>

### 1.5.3 Charts

Century Gothic Bold, font size 11 should be used for the labels on graphs.

<br>
:::

## [1.6 Paragraph and Spacing]{.underline}

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
Text within paragraphs should be justified paragraphs. The following should be the line spacing used for text:

-   

          Paragraph spacing: Before: 12pt and After: 8pt

-   

          Line spacing: 1.15

<br>
:::

## [1.7 Bullets and Numbering]{.underline}

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   

          Round bullets (shown) should be used.

For lists with five or more items, numbers should be used instead of bullets.\]

When listing items ensure that there is consistency in the listed (verbs items as illustrated below:
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Consistent                     | Inconsistent                |
+================================+=============================+
| -   Training of field officers | -   Trained field officers; |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| -   Validation of data; and    | -   Data validation; and    |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| -   Writing of reports.        | -   Writing of reports      |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+

Bullet items should be limited to single words, phrases or one sentence.

When listing items that are complete sentences, each item should start with a capital letter and end with a full stop.

When listing items that are single words or short phrases, items should start with small letters (except when the first word is a proper noun. The subsequent items should start with a small letter. Each item apart from the last should end with a semicolon. The penultimate item should have "and" or "or" after the semicolon. The last item should end with a full stop. An example is shown below:

-   

          Worked at least one hour in their paid job or business activity;

-   

          Engaged in a family business for payment in cash or in kind; or

-   

          Had a paid job or business activity but were on temporary absence.

# 2. WRITING STYLE

## [2.1 Grammar and Style]{.underline}

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
All reports should be written in a formal professional style and free of grammatical and typographical errors. Writers are encouraged to utilise the word processing software or online editing tools to review their drafts before submission.
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
### 2.1.1 Language

GSS produces publications for diverse users including policy makers, civil society organisations, development partners and the private sector. As such reports should be written in clear non-technical language. Writers should use more common words and restrict usage of jargon to increase the readability of reports. When technical terms are used, they should be properly explained.

Reports should exclude:

-   

          contractions (e.g., can’t, don’t)

-   

          shorthand (e.g., &, cont’d,)

-   

          shortened word forms (e.g., org., dept.)

-   

          colloquial expressions (e.g., kids, folks, a bunch of, lots of)

-   

          idioms (e.g., deal with, on the flip side, boils down to)

Writers should also avoid the use of local slang such as dumsor (persistent power outages). Local slang can be used when there is no formal alternative, but should be italicised example, trotro, or chop bar. Where there is a formal but less recognised alternative, the slang can be inserted in parentheses e.g., female porters *(kayayei)*.

Reports should be written in the third person and avoid the use of personal pronouns such as, **I** and **we**.
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
### 1.1.2 Clarity

As much as possible, reports should use the active voice (e.g., the Statistical Service conducted a three-day training for five enumerators) and avoid the passive voice (e.g., five enumerators were trained for three days).

Writers should use specific figures and avoid subjective quantifiers such as many, a few, and most.

Writers should similarly avoid using adverbs such as very, really, and quite as descriptive words and rather use one fitting word e.g., rapidly (very quickly), sizeable (really large), moderately (quite slowly).
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
### 2.1.3 Verbosity

While there are no strict limits to sentence lengths, writers are advised to have an average of 12 to 15 words per sentence in their reports.

Similarly, writers are advised to average three to five sentences per paragraph.

Writers should aim for short succinct sentences. For instance, "The purpose of the pre-test was to assess the questionnaire" (10 words) can be "The pre-test assessed the questionnaire" (five words).

Phrases should be replaced with single words whenever possible. Some suggestions are provided below: .

<br>

| One word                 | Phrase                                    |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|

| Excludes                 | Does not include                          |
| Equivalent, similar      | The same as                               |

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
### 2.1.5 Punctuation

When a list within a sentence contains three or more items, a comma must be used after all items except the last one as shown below :

`This report presents data on literacy, current school attendance, and educational attainment.`

When items in the list contain commas, semicolons should be used to separate items as shown below:

`This publication targets Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs); Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs); development partners; civil society organisations (CSOs); private sector; research and academia; and the public.`

One space should separate sentences within a paragraph.

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
### 2.1.6 Subject verb agreement

Institutions are singular e.g., GSS produces quality data.

Data should be considered a collective noun e.g., the data shows fertility has declined overtime.

Statistics should be referred to in the plural e.g., statistics indicate that fertility has declined overtime.

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
### 2.1.7 Capitalisation of Words

Capital letters should be used for the first words in sentences and for proper nouns. Proper nouns refer to specific persons, or places. Common nouns, which are general, should not be capitalised. An example is shown below:

`We are also indebted to the universities for their technical support, particularly the University of Ghana and the University of Cape Coast.`

The names of regions should be capitalised as such Greater Accra Region. When referring to two or more regions however, regions must not be capitalised. An example is shown below:

`The Northern Region (14,031) has the highest number of girls aged 12 to 17 years who have ever been in union, followed distantly by the Ashanti (9,767) and Greater Accra regions (6,063).`

COVID-19 should be capitalised while coronavirus is written in small letters.

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## [2.2 Writing about Numbers]{.underline}

The following guidelines refer to numbers in text, charts, and tables.

All figures from one to nine should be written in words and those 10 and above should be written in figures. Exceptions include age e.g., persons aged 5 years and currency e.g., GH₵8.

Ordinal numbers from first to ninth must also be spelled out. 10th and above can be written in figures.

Numbers above 999 must be written with commas e.g., 511,622.

When a percentage figure is mentioned in a text, the words 'per cent' should follow the figure. However, if the figure is quoted in brackets, the percentage symbol (%) should be used. An example is:

`Among children engaged in economic activity, almost 80 per cent are involved in agriculture-related activities with the highest proportion in Savannah (89.8%) and the least in Greater Accra (26.2%).`

Sentences beginning with numbers should have the figures written out in words regardless of whether the number is below or above ten. An example is:

`Thirteen per cent of those who have attended school in the past have tertiary education as the highest level attained.`

Fractions (e.g., one-fifth) should be written in words.

Use "to" in text and not hyphens when referring to ranges e.g., 15 to 19 years.

Numbers above 1,000 should be fully written out and abbreviations (such as 1k) should not be used.

Numbers above 1,000,000 can be written in figures and words e.g., 2 million.

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## [2.3 Spelling]{.underline}

Spellings should follow the British convention. Examples are provided below:

Words ending in the following:

-   -se: e.g., organise and analyse

-   -our: e.g., colour and labour

-   -re: e.g., centre and kilometre

-   -il: e.g., fulfil and enrol

Words containing the following:

-   -mme- e.g., programme

-   -oe- e.g., foetus, diarrhoea

For consistency, writers should follow the conventions below for the following compound words:

-   Baseline and endline

-   Coordinator; coordinate

-   Cooperation, cooperate

-   Dataset Database

-   Decision-maker; decision-making

-   Email

-   Long-term

-   Metadata

-   Multidisciplinary

-   Online

-   Policy maker

-   Self-employment

-   Underperforming

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## [2.4 Use of Abbreviations]{.underline}

All abbreviations in reports must be fully spelled out when first mentioned.

Abbreviations should be written without full stops e.g., CAPI.

Abbreviated measurements (such as km, kg) are acceptable. When using abbreviated measures, there should be no space between number and measure e.g., 50km.

When using the abbreviated form of GSS, a definite article should not be used as illustrated below:

`The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) produces census and survey reports per its mandates or GSS produces census and survey reports per its mandates.`

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## [2.5 Use of Parentheses]{.underline}

As a rule, use round brackets.

However, parentheses within parentheses must be avoided. Square brackets should be used with round brackets to create a double enclosure in the text e.g., the Sustainable Development Goals **(\[SDGs\])**.

Parentheses next to parentheses must also be avoided. Square brackets should be used next to parentheses **(round brackets)** e.g., a third of the population **(32.7%)** **\[Figure 1\]**.

<br>
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## [2.6 References]{.underline}

Publications should utilise the [American Psychological Association]{.underline} (APA) style of referencing.

<br>

# 5. FORMATTING OF TABLES, CHARTS AND HIGHLIGHTS

## [5.1 Tables]{.underline}

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
All figures in tables should be single-spaced and right indented, and headings centred.

Absolute numbers in tables must have a comma separator for numbers that are more than three digits (i.e., 1,123).

Use of decimal points for percentages must be consistent throughout the document. One decimal place is recommended for all tables.

For tables that span more than one page, each page should have the table header repeated but not the table name.

The table heading should include the section/chapter number and the table number under that chapter and separated by (.).

The table name must provide information on the sample, the indicator being presented in the table and the levels of disaggregation in that order. An example is:

`Table 5.1: Population 15 years and older by economic activity status, sex, type of locality and region`

Table names and headers must indicate the units of measurement e.g., percent, GH₵.

Tables should have a top and bottom border but not right and left borders. Within the table only the table headers should have top and bottom borders as shown below:

![](images/tab.png)

Notes can be added under tables as needed, to provide supplementary detail.
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## 5.2 Charts

Numerical numbering should be used for all charts which should reflect the section/chapter number and the figure number.

Use of decimal points must be consistent throughout the document. One decimal place is recommended for all charts. Exceptions to this rule are currency (GH₵14.50) and age (24 years)

The name of the chart must provide information on the sample, the indicator being presented in the table and the levels of disaggregation in that order. An example is:

`Figure 5.1: Proportion of economically active persons 15 years and older by type of locality and sex`
:::

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## 5.3 Highlights

For each highlight, there should be one graph to illustrate the finding and one to three sentences explaining the key finding.

**Century Gothic size 14** in **white colour** should be used for highlights with a blue (**#2E37FF**) background as shown below:

`Figure 2: Example of a highlight`

![](images/highlight.png)
:::

# 6. DATA VISUALISATION

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
## [6.1 Graphs]{.underline}

Century Gothic Bold, font size 12 should be used for the labels and values on the graph. All axes should be labelled and where possible, the values for data points should be indicated on the graph.

### 6.1.1 Pie Charts

Pie charts should be used to show the composition of a sample as illustrated below. They should only be used when the sum of the parts is 100%. Pie charts should have a maximum of five categories.

![](images/donut.png){fig-align="center" width="305"}

### 6.1.2 Bar/Column Charts

Bar/column charts should be used for comparisons as illustrated below. The bars should be sorted with values in ascending order (from largest to smallest). The only exceptions are for the "other" category and "none" which can be placed at the last position.

![](images/bar1.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

![](images/multibar.png){fig-align="center"}

### 6.1.3 Stacked Bar/Column Charts

Stacked bar/column charts should be used to compare the composition of different groups. It is best to utilise percentages so that the heights of all the bars will be equal except in cases, where the absolute numbers are being highlighted.

![](images/stack.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/stack2.png){fig-align="center" width="663"}

### 6.1.4 Dot/Range Plots

Dot/Range Plots should be used to display differences between two indicators, or a range of values as shown below.

![](images/dot.png){fig-align="center"}

### 6.1.5 Line Graphs

Line graphs should be used to present trends over time or for continuous variables such as age or ordered categories such as educational level.

![](images/line.png){fig-align="center"}

### 6.1.6 Scatter Plots

Scatter plots can be used to compare two variables to illustrate the correlation between the two.

![](images/scatter.png)

### 6.1.7 Other Charts

Other types of data visualisations can be used as determined by the data.

![](images/other.png){fig-align="center"}
